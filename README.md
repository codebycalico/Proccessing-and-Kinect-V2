# Proccessing and Kinect V2
 Working with the Kinect in Processing.

Using the KinectPV2 library with the Kinect V2 and Processing 3.5.4. Must use these specs.

Adapted some of the Open Kinect for Processing library by Daniel Schiffman to work with the Kinect PV2 library by Thomas Lengeling.

Kinect is no longer supported by Microsoft (or anyone), so had to figure out how to merge the two libraries together to create this example.

This is an example of a very rough interactive, color coded AR sandbox.
